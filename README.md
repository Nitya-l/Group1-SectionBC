## Overview of our App
The data we use in our app comes from multiple sources around the globe that was then consolidated by the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation. In addition to providing information related to the death rate of 33 fatal pathogens, our app allows users to filter information by bacterial infections caused by pathogens, locations around the world, and age groups. We hope that these tools will serve as a resource that provides healthcare professionals such as epidemiologists and clinicians with the data they need to understand which pathogens and bacterial symptoms they need to target their work towards in order to reduce the number of deaths caused by certain fatal pathogens. With our app, they will be able to visualize and interact with only the data they need to make their decisions, allowing them to spend more time on curating and following through an action plan to reduce deaths.
